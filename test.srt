1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Who's a handsome boy?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Come on, Solomon! Come on, baby!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Over here!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Woo!

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Hey!

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Solomon!

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 You hear me?

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Come on, Solomon! Come on, baby!

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hey, do you want something to drink?

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I don't drink.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Well, not even water?

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Do you have any idea what they put in water?

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Over here!

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Woo!

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Hey, good boy! Good Solomon! Good Solomon! Good boy! Good boy!

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Keep working! Hurry up!

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I can only get a detention for so long!

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 High boy! High boy!

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Fix it!

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I ought to work in silence!

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Oh! Oh!

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Sheep-fart!

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Stop it!

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 No! No!

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Wait!

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Solomon!

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Solomon! Come here! Come here!

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Come here! Oh, God!

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Don't turn around!

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Don't turn around!

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 They don't want me!

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I am filled with scotch and bitterness and impure thoughts!

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I can hear ferris right now! For cream!

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Got it!

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Afternoon, Solomon!

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I'm sorry!

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Hey, mister! Everybody says you're a dick.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I don't know what that means, but I don't believe it.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I don't think it's gonna work.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But good luck.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yeah!

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Hey, listen.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I want to see you here opening day.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I don't fraternize, Mr. Me.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm sure I'll have plenty of reports.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 We can open.
